* Introduction

  Org-page is a static page generator based on [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].

  Org-page is designed to enhance the org publish process(only improve
  the html format), actually the publish process of org mode is already
  simple and powerful enough, but org-page can make it simpler and more
  powerful.

  And, org-page is only a static page generator, NOT an "org to blog"
  program, if you want to write blog with org mode, you may could have
  a look at [[https://github.com/renard/o-blog][o-blog]], or [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]].

  Org-page provides following features:

  1) recent posts support (auto generated)
  2) tags support (auto generated)
  3) search engine support (auto generated)
  4) a much more beautiful theme than the default one
  5) customized theme support
  6) highly customizable

* Usage

** installation

   - clone the repo from github:

     : git clone http://github.com/kelvinh/org-page.git

   - add following lines into your =.emacs= file:

     : (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/org-page")
     : (require 'org-page)
     : (setq op/root-directory "path/to/your/project")
     : (setq op/publish-search-url "your.personal.site.com")
     : (global-set-key (kbd "<f9>") 'op/publish-pages)
     : (global-set-key (kbd "C-<f9>") (lambda () (interactive)
     :                                           (op/publish-pages t)))


   =op/root-directory= is the directory for your project, note that it
   is *NOT* the directory for you to put your org files, instead you
   should put all your org files into a subdirectory named ~src~, and
   all published files will be placed into a subdirectory named ~pub~

   =op/publish-search-url= stands for your personal site, which the
   search engine will base on

** publishing

   Now you can publish your org files with a single key press: *<F9>*,
   or if you want to republish all your files even they have already
   been published and not modified since last publishing, your can
   just press *Ctrl + <F9>*.

* Dependencies

  1. [[http://orgmode.org/][org mode]]: which is already included in Emacs
  2. [[http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/htmlize.el.cgi][htmlize]]: a package for converting Emacs fontification into HTML
