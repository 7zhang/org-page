Example Setup Instructions
==========================

This directory contains files for you to try org-page with, this readme file
details how to setup org-page and run the example. If you want to learn more
about org-page, you may want to have a look at the file README.org at the
project's root folder.


Let's begin to make things work:

1. Clone the org-page repo, the instructions assume that you will put it under
   the home directory:

     $ cd ~
     $ git clone git://github.com/kelvinh/org-page

2. Start your emacs.

3. In your emacs' *scratch* buffer, input the following code:

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/org-page/")
     (require 'org-page)
     (setq op/root-directory "~/org-page/example/")
     (setq op/publish-site-url "http://your.site.url.here")
     (setq op/personal-disqus-shortname "your_disqus_name")

     (op/publish-pages t)


   !! Notice: Please remember to replace the site url and disqus shortname
              with your real site url and disqus shortname in the code.

4. Then, press M-x, input "eval-buffer", and hit the Enter key.

5. After several seconds, you will see the success info in minibuffer.

6. Check directory "~/org-page/example/", there will be a folder "pub", copy
   this folder to your local http server and then visit the site through your
   browser, also you could open the html file directly to see its contents if
   you do not have a local http server. 

7. OK, now it is your turn to publish your own org files, but not just have
   fun with the example, good luck. :-D
